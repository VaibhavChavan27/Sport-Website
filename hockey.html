            <ul>
                <li>The first and most important rule in hockey is that players can only hit the ball on the flat side of their stick. </li>
                <li>Other than the goalkeeper, hockey players are not allowed to control the ball with their feet or any other part of their body at any moment. </li>
                <li>A field goal is an open-play goal that can only be scored from within the striking circle, in front of the opponentâ€™s goal. </li>
                <li>Because hockey is a non-contact sport, all fouls result in either a free hit or a penalty corner for the non-offending side, depending on the location and severity of the infringement.</li>
