            <li>Cricket rules are not that complicated to understand. Cricket involves basic equipment - the ball, the bat, and accessories. These are the ABCs of cricket and will help you understand the rest of the rules.</li>
            <li>Cricket is a team game played between two teams of 11 players each. The 11 players constitute batsmen, bowlers and a wicket keeper.</li>
            <li>The match is usually played on a large circular or oval shaped ground. There is also a smaller inner oval with a 22 yard pitch at the centre. At each end of the pitch is a set of three wickets with two wooden bails atop them.</li>
            <li>The match is broken down into separate sections called balls, which is one delivery of the ball bowled by a bowler to a batsman. Six of these balls form an over.</li>
            <li>An innings is made of a specific number of overs or a certain amount of time. A one day international match consists of 50 overs per innings, a twenty twenty international match consists of 20 overs per innings whereas a test match is limited to a certain number of days which is 5 with 90 overs to be played on each day.</li>
